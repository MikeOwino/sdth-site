        The Bright Ideas Hackathon program is a series of Hackathons that will give underprivileged youth aged 13-18 exposure to creating apps or digital product ideas that bridge the digital and physical world with mobile technology and bluetooth low energy beacons. All skill levels are encouraged to participate. Volunteers will be available to help with designing the UI/UX as well as development.

        Teams will be organized within 3 age groups (under 14, under 16 and under 18). Any participant may join a team in an older age bracket.

        Final submissions will be judged based on innovation, teamwork, communication, and implementation.

        The winning teams from each event will have an opportunity to have local developers (open source community members and college/code school students) assist them in building out their project/idea as an open source project.

        How to Get Involved:

        We're looking for volunteers and sponsors. See signup form.

        Every Saturday from 10AM to 2PM, community members from around San Diego get together to collaboratively contribute to open source projects.

        The group is open to people of all backgrounds, skill levels, and expertise. It is generously hosted by Dan Hendricks at Open Source Maker Labs in Vista. Open source is about more than software, thus OSML provides the tools necessary to contribute to hardware and IoT projects as well. OSML features a full workshop with 3D printing, electronics, robotics, and CNC machines.

        (1) Create a fun, motivating, inclusive environment to foster consistent open source contributions.

        (2) Provide an avenue for mentorship so newer devs can learn how to contribute to open source. From git workflows to branching strategies to commit messages, participants will learn the conventions of working with git on a collaborative team.

        (3) Establish San Diego as a hotbed of open source contribution.

        If you are an open source maintainer, or if you are familiar with a particular project, Open Source Saturday is a great opportunity to onboard new contributors. If you are a new developer who would like to learn how to contribute to open source, you will find experienced contributors who can provide guidance. If you are an experienced developer yourself, you will find a motivating, collaborative atmosphere to have fun making new contributions. And if you are not a programmer, the group could use your insights into visual design, user experience, accessibility, and more.

        How to get involved:

        (1) Attend Open Source Saturday from 10AM - 2PM at Open Source Maker Labs in Vista: https://maps.app.goo.gl/a34HK.

        (2) Start your own Open Source Saturday Meetup by filling out the form.

        The SDTH Network is a community driven project aimed at connecting needs to opportunities. There are two points to the network:

        (1) Community: This includes individuals, businesses, organizations that have an interest in finding jobs, sourcing talent or making a difference.

        (2) Needs and Opportunities: This includes providing resources, experience, and access to events based on the community need.

        The problems we want to solve include:

        (1) Help talent (i.e., skilled, transitioning, or new) and qualified jobs with no friction or barrier to entry.

        (2) Provide free or discounted resources (i.e., collaboration space, food, speakers, other services) to individuals in need.

        (3) Promote the concept of collaboration over competition by providing visibility to various program and events encouraging partnerships

        How to get involved:

        The development team is focused on Problem #1: Help Talent and qualified jobs with no friction or barrier to entry.

        As part of this, we are currently doing a user sessions to understand needs and pain points for:

        (1) individuals (trying to find a job across various skill sets/experiences)
        (2) businesses (looking for talent that matches their needs), and educational
        (3) institutions (seeking to find the right criteria to ensure their students are marketable for the workforce).

        The mission of San Diego Tech Talks is to bring high quality content to the San Diego community about once a month to bring people in the tech community together. The talks are usually a blend of two disciplines to get people interested in tech that may not have had a previous avenue into the discipline. For instance, how is machine learning affecting finance? Think TED Talks, but live and in San Diego. At each event, companies will get a chance to broadcast opportunities at their companies and individuals will get a chance to announce their skillsets to continue to grow and diversify our community.

        How to get involved:

        Join the meetup at https://www.meetup.com/Carlsbad-Tech-Talks/ or contact ryan@airspacetechnologies.com if you are interested in helping out!
