        <p>The goal of the Be the Boss program is to show that being an entrepreneur doesnâ€™t take a lot of money or fancy degrees.</p>

        <p>The six week program is targeted at passionate underrepresented youth that do not readily have access to business and entrepreneurial resources to help them formulate a legitimate business idea.</p>

        <p>The vision is to create a network of young entrepreneurs that will learn from one another, teach each other, and spread the message that anyone can be their own boss.</p>

        <p>In this program, the students will learn the skills to take a passion, build a pitch, learn marketing techniques, and make their business idea a reality.  The goal is to build confidence, pride, and hope for these students.</p>

        <p>Every Saturday from 10AM to 2PM, community members from around San Diego get together to collaboratively contribute to open source projects.</p>

        <p>The group is open to people of all backgrounds, skill levels, and expertise. It is generously hosted by Dan Hendricks at Open Source Maker Labs in Vista. Open source is about more than software, thus OSML provides the tools necessary to contribute to hardware and IoT projects as well. OSML features a full workshop with 3D printing, electronics, robotics, and CNC machines.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Create a fun, motivating, inclusive environment to foster consistent open source contributions.</li>

          <li>Provide an avenue for mentorship so newer devs can learn how to contribute to open source. From git workflows to branching strategies to commit messages, participants will learn the conventions of working with git on a collaborative team.</li>

          <li>Establish San Diego as a hotbed of open source contribution.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you are an open source maintainer, or if you are familiar with a particular project, Open Source Saturday is a great opportunity to onboard new contributors. If you are a new developer who would like to learn how to contribute to open source, you will find experienced contributors who can provide guidance. If you are an experienced developer yourself, you will find a motivating, collaborative atmosphere to have fun making new contributions. And if you are not a programmer, the group could use your insights into visual design, user experience, accessibility, and more.</p>

        <p><b>How to get involved:</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>Attend Open Source Saturday from 10AM - 2PM at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/a34HK">Open Source Maker Labs in Vista</a></li>

        <p>The mission of San Diego Tech Talks is to bring high quality content to the San Diego community about once a month to bring people in the tech community together.</p>

        <p>The talks are usually a blend of two disciplines to get people interested in tech that may not have had a previous avenue into the discipline.</p>

        <p>For instance, how is machine learning affecting finance? Think TED Talks, but live and in San Diego. At each event, companies will get a chance to broadcast opportunities at their companies and individuals will get a chance to announce their skillsets to continue to grow and diversify our community.</p>
